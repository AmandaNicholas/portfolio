Hi, I'm Amanda. I've been a technical writer in the software industry since 2009.

What tools do I use?
====================

When you're looking to hire a Technical Writer, you might be wondering how they've produced documentation in the past, and if they'll be able to hit the ground running with your desired tools. 

Or, you might be wanting them to advise on the best tool so you can make an informed decision. 

Fear not, I'm confident working with a range of documentation tools, including Content Management Systems (CMS), wikis, single-source authoring software and word processing tools. 

In previous jobs I've used:

* Confluence
* Wordpress
* Authorit
* Microsoft Word
* Google Docs suite.

I've worked with start-ups to corporate to community organisations. Every business has their unique documentation requirements. 

The best tool for your business will depend on your budget, your writers, the system itself, and the needs of your users. The goal is to create great content that can be easily maintained in the future. 

Working closely with development teams
--------------------------------------

Recently, the tools used to generate documentation have become similar to those used by developers. 

Businesses likely thought that writers using developer tools would provide a wonderful opportunity for developers to contribute to documentation (ha ha). In reality, developers tend to focus development and shy away from the documentation part (funny that!) 

Happily, developer tools (like sophisticated text editors and version control) have proven excellent for software documentation. Now it's so easy to collaborate with other writers on the team, and the review process is easier too. 

The writer toolchain I've been using involves writing text files in a "markup language" called Resructured Text (reST). Developers might be more familiar with Markdown, which is similar to reST. These source files are then turned into HTML using a static site generator (Sphinx). To use these tools, I've become competent in:

* Visual Studio Code 
* Restructured text (reST)
* Markdown
* Git (for distributed Version Control)
* GitHub (for hosting and review process).

All of these have been a revelation in how to participate in software documentation as part of a team, and about the evolution of software documentation in general. 

What about the pictures?
------------------------

Sometimes there's just no better way to communicate a piece of information than using a diagram. 

I'm familiar with the principles of UML (Universal Modelling Language) to communicate concepts where there can often be gaps in understanding between the technical and non-technical folk.

To create diagrams, and to mark up screen shots, my tools of choice are:

* Snagit
* Draw.io 
* Microsoft Visio.

Are you a developer?
--------------------

No, I'm not, but I can use the Command Prompt and set my IDE to dark mode, so I'm practically there!

Jokes aside, as years go by I enjoy learning more about computers and programming as essential life skills. I also find that even developers need to Google and consult Stack Overflow about the simple stuff. That's why I believe that simple, logical, well-constructed documentation is so important. Even for developer audiences (especially those whose first language may not be English), it is worth starting at the beginning to make sure there is no confusion.
