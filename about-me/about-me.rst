Hi, I'm Amanda. I've been a technical writer in the software industry since 2009.

What tools do I use?
====================

When you're looking to hire a Technical Writer, you might be wondering how they've produced documentation in the past, and if they'll be able to hit the ground running with your desired tools. 

Or, you might be wanting them to advise on the best tool so you can make an informed decision. 

Fear not, I'm confident working with a range of documentation tools, including Content Management Systems (CMS), wikis, single-source authoring software and word processing tools. 

In previous jobs I've used:

* Confluence
* Wordpress
* Author-it
* Microsoft Word
* Google Docs suite.

I've worked with a wide variety of organisations, from start-ups to corporate to community groups. Every organisation has their unique documentation requirements. 

The best tool for your organisation will depend on your budget, your writers, the system itself, and the needs of your users. The goal is to create great content that can be easily maintained in the future. 

Working closely with development teams
--------------------------------------

In recent years the tools used to generate documentation have become similar to those used by developers. 

Businesses likely thought that by having tech writers use the same tools as developers, the developers themselves might be more likely to contribute to the documentation too. In reality, once the code is done, developers aren't really that interested in the documentation part (funny that!) 

Happily however, developer tools (like sophisticated text editors and version control) are actually excellent tools for software documentation. Now it's so easy to keep track of changes and safely back up your source files. It's also much easier to collaborate with other writers on the team and get peer reviews. 

The writer toolchain I've been using involves writing text files in a "markup language" called Resructured Text (reST). Developers might be more familiar with Markdown, which is similar to reST. These source files are then turned into HTML using a static site generator (Sphinx). 

To use these tools, I've become competent in:

* Integrated Development Environments (eg IntelliJ CE and Visual Studio Code) 
* Restructured text (reST)
* Markdown
* Git (for distributed Version Control)
* GitHub (for hosting and review process).

These free tools have revolutionalised how writers can participate in software documentation as part of a team. Personally I find it exciting to be part of the evolution of software documentation. 

What about the pictures?
------------------------

Sometimes there's just no better way to communicate a piece of information than using a diagram. 

I'm familiar with the principles of UML (Universal Modelling Language) to communicate concepts between the technical and non-technical folk.

To create diagrams, and to mark up screen shots, my tools of choice are:

* Snagit
* Draw.io 
* Microsoft Visio.

Are you a developer?
--------------------

No, I'm not, but I can use the Command Prompt and set my IDE to dark mode, so I'm practically there!

Jokes aside, as years go by I enjoy learning more about computers and programming as essential life skills. I also find that even developers need to Google and consult Stack Overflow about the simple stuff. That's why I believe that simple, logical, well-constructed documentation is so important. Even for developer audiences (especially those whose first language may not be English), it is worth starting at the beginning to make sure there is no confusion.
