End-user guides
===============

A good end-user guide will understand the users' needs and be task-oriented (focused on the tasks they need to complete). 

Depending on the system, and limitations/requirements of the business and consumers of the document, they can be delivered in many different formats. Below are some examples.

Sample end-user guides
----------------------

These samples are still under NDA; please email me for more information.

* A PDF user guide for a cloud application to perform remote tasks (such as software upgrades) to payment terminals
* Online user guides (delivered via secure website) for a fleet management application
* Online user guides (delivered as online help within the application) for a Learning Management System (LMS)
* Procedure documents (in Microsoft Word) for an inventory-management system. The delivery was in Word at request of the business - they wished to allow changes to easily be made in future and Word was their desired editing tool.

API documentation
=================

Recently there's been a lot of demand for companies to expose APIs to go with their products. 

And documentation of the API is a big selling-point - clients are much more likely to use an API with great documentation. 

Sample API User Guides
----------------------

These samples are still under NDA; please email me for more information.

I created the following API documentation for the below RESTful web APIs. Messages were sent and received in JSON.

* An API to create and deploy media content to the screens on outdoor payment terminals
* An API to create mobile apps that allow a customer to pre-pay for fuel and authorize fuel pumps for delivery.

In addition I redeveloped older documentation using XML messages for a Fuel Controller (FCC). The API allowed Point of Sale (POS) software to interact with the FCC on a gas station forecourt.

.. note:: Documenting these APIs required me to become familiar with developer documentation of APIs (eg Swagger). I also tested all messages used in the documentation using Postman. 

Quick Start Guides
==================

There are many use-cases for a Quick Start Guide to be part of your documentation package. It's also a great sales tool and not too bulky to easily point out some of the best parts of your software. 

Sample quick start guides
-------------------------

The following Quick Start Guides are still under NDA; please email me for more information.

* Outdoor Payment Terminal - single unit
* Outdoor Payment Terminal - modular unit
* Fleet Management Software-as-a-Service Application.
