End-user guides
===============

A good end-user guide will understand the users' needs and be task-oriented (focused on the tasks they need to complete). 

Depending on the system, and limitations/requirements of the business and consumers of the document, they can be delivered in many different formats. Below are some examples.

Sample end-user guides
----------------------

These samples are still under NDA; please email me for more information.

      - **Description**

.. note:: Delivery of these documents was in MS Word at request of the business. Although it is not my delivery tool of choice, the company wished their employees to be able to easily edit these documents in the future, and Word was their desired editing tool.

API documentation
=================

Recently there's been a lot of demand for companies to expose APIs to go with their products. 

And documentation of the API is a big selling-point: clients are much more likely to use an API with great documentation. 

Sample API User Guides

These samples are still under NDA; please email me for more information.

I created the following API documentation for the below RESTful web APIs. Messages were sent and received in JSON.

.. list-table::

   *  - **Doc Type**
      - **Description**
      - **Delivery**
   *  - API Developer Guide   
      - For creating and deploying media content to the screens on outdoor payment terminals.
      - PDF
   *  - API Developer Guide
      - For creating mobile apps that allow a customer to pre-pay for fuel and authorise fuel pumps for delivery.
      - PDF

In addition I redeveloped older documentation for a Fuel Controller (FCC) API. Messages were sent and received in XML.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 30 10 
   :header-rows: 1

   *  - **Doc Type**
      - **Description**
      - **Delivery**
   *  - API Developer Guide   
      - For Point of Sale (POS) software to interact with the FCC to authorize pumps on a petrol station forecourt.
      - PDF

.. note:: Documenting these APIs required me to become familiar with developer documentation of APIs (eg Swagger). I also tested all messages and responses using Postman. 

Quick Start Guides
==================

There are many use-cases for a Quick Start Guide to be part of your documentation package. It's also a great sales tool to easily point out some of the best parts of your software.
